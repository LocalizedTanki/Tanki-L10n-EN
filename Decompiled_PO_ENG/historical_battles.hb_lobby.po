"Military correspondent Tvardovsky knew firsthand what this truly popular instrument meant for a frontline soldier. In every rifle platoon or artillery battery, in every aviation regiment, tank crew and self-propelled gun, sailors and submariners, there was their own \"Tyorkin\" harmonist. Witnesses of Victory share a common memory - the harmonica tunes. On that day, the whole country, the entire army, all of Europe sang and danced to the Russian harmonica.\n"
"\n"
"During the Great Patriotic War, harmonicas were specifically sent to the front to boost the morale of the soldiers. By the end of the summer of 1941, 12,000 of these musical instruments were sent to the front. In the fall of the same year, over 60,000 were sent. In 1942, at the request of the Political Administration of the Soviet Army, the local industry commissariat of the RSFSR obliged the Shuya and Tula factories to retool production for the production of harmonicas and bayans."

"Perhaps the word \"war\" is the most terrifying and destructive word in the world. And a cat, perhaps, is the most affectionate and cozy animal in the world. But history has shown how often, unfortunately, these two words find themselves side by side. When trouble comes to the human world, it inevitably affects cats as well. And it turns out that these pets are not only not a burden in times of great trials but can also help people. The psychotherapeutic effect of having a cat has been noted in many armies around the world. The hypersensitivity of these animals, allowing them to predict air raids long before it is possible with air defense, can also be of great service. During the siege of Leningrad, cats brought their prey to their owners, warmed children with their small bodies, and protected food stores from rats.\n"

"The Maxim machine gun, created in 1883 in Britain, is one of the most popular and mass-produced in the world. No major armed conflict was without it. The appearance of the Maxim machine gun largely determined and changed the tactics of war - it turned into positional warfare. Hiram Maxim's machine guns were used during World War I and the Civil War, mounted as heavy machine guns, installed on armored cars and armored trains. The machine gun survived until World War II. The design of the Maxim machine gun was morally outdated by the late 1930s, but the machine gun continued to be produced until 1945, and until the end of production, it remained the main heavy machine gun of the Red Army. Defenders of the Brest Fortress met the enemy with a Maxim machine gun, and it was used in many defensive operations - it was fired by defenders of Moscow and Stalingrad.\n"

In photographs of those years, you can see the concern on the faces of people gathering around the loudspeakers when the enemy advanced, and the real joy when Yuri Levitan announced front victories and the liberation of another city.\n"
