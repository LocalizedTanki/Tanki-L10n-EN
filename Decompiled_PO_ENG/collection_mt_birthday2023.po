"The best solutions, the boldest and most fundamental changes, constant "
"improvements - all of this requires inspiration. And our constant source of "

"The master class of any \"firefly\" is to ensure victory in battle in the "
"first seconds, taking a key position, control of which turns the battle into"
" a one-way game. The main thing is not to shoot, not to jerk, not to make "
"sudden movements... To achieve victory without firing a single shot? Easy! "
"To take first place in experience without firing a single shot? Try it, it's"
" really fun."

"Our game is a real virtual museum that can initiate in-depth study of "

"stands famous. It's much more interesting for you to visit thematic museums:"
" you meet \"old friends\" who are waiting for battle in your Garage. You "
"start doing stand modeling, find inconsistencies in art films... You have "
"clearly become a more curious and immersed person, isn't that great?"

"We still need to figure out from what cosmic paranormal alloy the French "

"Just in case, we'll remind you that styles or camouflage add a bonus to "
