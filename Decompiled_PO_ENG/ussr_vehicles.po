"Koshkin. On May 18, 1938, technical characteristics of the tank designated "
"BT-20 were approved. Only a few experimental prototypes, with a wheeled "

У выніку танк М47 «Romach» не быў рэалізаваны ў метале і застаўся на паперы.

"Праграма распрацоўкі ізраільскага асноўнага танка была зацверджана ў жніўні 1970-га года, пасля таго як стала зразумела, што Вялікабрытанія не стане прадаваць Ізраілю танкі «Чыфтэн». Танк атрымаў назву «Меркава» — так называліся біблейскія баявыя калясніцы. Каманду распрацоўшчыкаў узначаліў генерал-маёр Ісраэль Таль. Dзякуючы гэтаму пры распрацоўцы быў улічаны шырокі досвед араба-ізраільскіх войнаў, а таксама геаграфічныя асаблівасці Блізкага Усходу. Праз крайні дэфіцыт асабовага складу ўпор быў зроблены на абароненасць. Абарона машыны вырашалася комплексна: корпус і вежа атрымлівалі разнесенае браніраванне, а МТА павінна было знаходзіцца спераду: меркавалася зрабіць рухавік і трансмісію дадатковым элементам абароны экіпажа. Першы прататып быў сабраны ў 1973 годзе, прайшоў праграму выпрабаванняў. У канцы 1974 быў завершаны перадсерыйны экзэмпляр «Меркавы», створаны з улікам вынікаў выпрабаванняў прататыпаў. У 1978 танк быў афіцыйна прадстаўлены на Dні Незалежнасці, а першыя чатыры серыйныя машыны былі перададзены ў Армію Абароны Ізраіля ў 1979 годзе.\n"

Згодна з праектам, пры пэўным росце масы танк атрымліваў ахоўныя блокі, што значна ўзмацняла супрацькумулятыўную абарону. Таксама паляпшалася абарона ад кінетычных снарадаў. Dля зручнасці кіравання ў паходным рэжыме ў левым пярэднім блоку прадугледжваўся выраз, а сам блок (разам з суседнім) можна было падымаць. Апцыянальна прапаноўвалася замена 100-mm гарматы D-10Т на больш сучасную 105-mm гармату L7A3, якая перавышала савецкую як бронепрабіўнай здольнасцю снарадаў, так і дакладнасцю. На жаданне замоўцаў прапаноўвалася таксама мадэрнізацыя састарэлых сродкаў сувязі, прылад назірання, прыцэльных прыстасаванняў і замена кулямётаў на нямецкія MG. 3.

Główną różnicą pomiędzy czołgiem a bardziej znanym czołgiem podstawowym Vickers był znacznie lepszy pancerz. Zgodnie z założeniami projektu pojazd miał być wyważony i harmonijny pod względem walorów bojowych. Działo kal. 105 mm nadal pozwalało na walkę z przeciwnikami, a silnik wysokoprężny zapewniał dobrą mobilność. Jednakże z wielu powodów czołg Vickers MBT EXP nie wszedł do masowej produkcji, między innymi z powodu własnego programu budowy czołgu przez kraje będące celem eksportu oraz wyboru innych dostawców sprzętu wojskowego.\n"

The entire package of design documentation was captured by intelligence and sent to the design bureau of NPPO \"Perspektiva\" to study the feasibility of such a design and the possibility of building and combat use of both self-propelled guns of this type as a whole and individual units and assemblies. As an additional measure to ensure secrecy, a non-standard paint job and artistic treatment of armor plates were chosen so that the vehicle would look more like a sample of modern art and an exhibit, rather than a combat self-propelled gun.\n"

Першыя Т-54Б уяўлялі сабой Т-54А з усталяваннем новага двухплоскаснага стабілізатара ўзбраення СТВ-2 «Цыклон». Падчас вытворчасці ў канструкцыю машыны быў унесены шэраг змен. Танк аснашчаўся камплектам прыбораў назірання, прыцэлам начнога бачання і штатным камплектам АПВТ. Кожная чацвёртая машына адаптавалася пад усталяванне супрацьміннага трала ПТ-54/-54М. Падчас эксплуатацыі на Т-54Б маглі ўсталёўвацца каткі двух розных тыпаў: раннія — з літымі дыскамі з перагародкамі (т.зв. «павук»), і познія — з літымі дыскамі каробчатага тыпу (т. зв. «марская зорка»), прычым яны маглі стаяць у любым парадку, у тым ліку несіметрычна адносна бартоў.\n"

"Работы по созданию нового среднего танка Объект 407 были начаты во ВНИИ-100 в начале 1953 года. При проектировании этого танка конструкторы руководствовались следующими основными принципами: 1. Применением узлов бронезащиты нового типа, обеспечивающих повышенные защитные свойства с одновременным увеличением внутренних забронированных объемов; 2. Обеспечением увеличенного объёма боевого отделения за счёт уплотнения компоновки остальных отделений танка; 3. Применением наиболее совершенных механизмов, обладающих минимальными габаритами и весом, а также наилучшими коэффициентами полезного действия. К таким механизмам относился и механизм заряжания пушки, существенно увеличивавший скорострельности. В конечном итоге в связи с изменившимися требованиями Объект 407 так и остался на бумаге, но на его основе в 1954 году был разработан более совершенный танк, получивший индекс Объект 907.\n"

Першы прататып PzKpfw Maus V1 быў знойдзены на стрэльбішчы Кумэрсдорфскага палігона. Немцы беспаспяхова спрабавалі падарваць машыну, каб яна не трапіла ў рукі Чырвонай арміі. На момант выяўлення танк быў часткова разукамплектаваны і знаходзіўся ў непрацоўным стане. Dругі прататып PzKpfw Maus V2 быў падарваны нямецкімі войскамі падчас адступлення праз немагчымасць эвакуяваць машыну. Увосень 1945 гады на шасі PzKpfw Maus V1 усталявалі вежу з падарванага PzKpfw Maus V2. У маі 1946 года танк прыбыў на тэрыторыю НDІБТ палігона ў Кубінцы. Правесці хадавыя выпрабаванні разукамплектаванага танка было немагчыма, аднак быў праведзены абстрэл корпуса і вежы. У такім выглядзе танк «Маўс» экспануецца ў Бранятанкавым музеі ў Кубінцы (Тэхнічны цэнтр парка «Патрыёт») па цяперашні час.\n"

"In 1944, work on Soviet heavy tanks was conducted in three directions. Fundamentally new vehicles were being developed: Object 701 (IS-4) and Object 703 (Kirovets-1). Work was also underway on a deep modernization of the IS-2, assigned to Plant No. 100. As a result of this work, a new tank with more powerful armor and weapons, the Object 252, better known as the IS-6, was created. In the winter of 1944, the prototype underwent tests, according to the results of which it was superior to the IS-2 in many respects, but inferior to the promising IS-4. In addition, a number of technical shortcomings were identified in the IS-6. In particular, with the D-30T cannon, which failed during testing. The tank was supposed to be equipped with a BL-13 cannon with a rammer; more powerful than the D-30T. The remaining shortcomings could also be eliminated, but the Kirovets-1 successfully passed the tests almost simultaneously, and turned out to be more protected, simpler and more reliable. The GBTU KA and NKTP decided to further develop the Kirovets-1, which put an end to the IS-6 project.\n"
